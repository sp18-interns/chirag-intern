### [30, 10, 12, 8, 15, 1]

### Step - 1: Get the length of the array.

### length = len(array) â†’ 6

### Step - 2: First, we set the first element as minimum element.

### Step - 3: Now compare the minimum with the second element. If the second element is smaller than the first, we assign it as a minimum.

### Again we compare the second element to the third and if the third element is smaller than second, assign it as minimum. This process goes on until we find the last element.

### Step - 4: After each iteration, minimum element is swapped in front of the unsorted array.

### Step - 5: The second to third steps are repeated until we get the sorted array.
