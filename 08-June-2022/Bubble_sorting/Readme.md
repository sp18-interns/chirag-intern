# Bubble Sorting:-

### Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order.

## 1. Time Complexities of Bubble sort:

```
-> Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
    If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then the worst case occurs.

-> Best Case Complexity: O(n)
    If the array is already sorted, then there is no need for sorting.
-> Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
    It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).
```

### 2. Space Complexity

```
-> Space complexity is: O(1) because an extra variable is used for swapping.
    In the optimized bubble sort algorithm, two extra variables are used. Hence, the space complexity will be O(2).
```
