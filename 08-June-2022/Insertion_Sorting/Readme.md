# Insertion Sorting:-

### Insertion sort is the simple method of sorting an array. In this technique, the array is virtually split into the sorted and unsorted part. An element from unsorted part is picked and is placed at correct position in the sorted part.

## 1. Time Complexities of Insertion sort:

```
->Worst case: The worst case time complexity of Insertion sort is O(N^2)
-> Average case: The average case time complexity of Insertion sort is O(N^2)
->  Best case:  The time complexity of the best case is O(N).
```

## 2. Space Complexity

```
-> The space complexity is O(1)
```
